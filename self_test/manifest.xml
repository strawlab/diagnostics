  <description brief="Tools relating to self-tests.">
    <p>  
      A self_test is a service call provided by a node that triggers a
      test of the driver and any associated hardware. This service call can
      be used by users to quickly verify that a device or process is working.
      Currently self-tests are mainly used with drivers, but nothing
      precludes non-driver nodes using them.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The self_test package contains tools to for calling the self-test
      service from the command-line, or from a regression test. It also
      provides a C++ API for facilitating writing of self-tests.
